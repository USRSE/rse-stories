# Being a Guest on RSE Stories

So you are interested in being a guest on the Research Software Engineer Stories podcast -
excellent! If you haven't read the background in the site's [about guide](https://us-rse.org/rse-stories/about/)
you might find it interesting. This guide will give you some information about what to expect
for your session.

## 1. Schedule

The first step is to express that you are interested in being on the show. We
currently have two hosts, [@vsoch](https://github.com/vsoch) 
(@v on USRSE and the UKRSE slack) and [Peter](https://github.com/pweschmidt)
who is based in the UK. Depending on your time zone, you might find it easier
to schedule with one host or the other. You can either contact a host directly,
or [fill out this interest form](https://forms.gle/8NBVQYwTgDs4X7HN7). Once you've
made contact, the host will answer any questions that you might have,
and schedule a time. Both hosts are currently releasing episodes once a month,
so your time might be scheduled in the far future. The host will
provide you a link to either a Zoom, Webex, or other session along with a calendar
invite for that day. At that point, all you have to do is show up! There
is no preparation required.

## 2. What to expect

### Atmosphere

The recording session is intended to be relaxed - you shouldn't worry
about speaking perfectly, or making mistakes. If you say something that you
want to try saying again, you can simply pause, take a breath, and start speaking
again. The episode will be edited to remove long pauses, verbal tics, or any
recorded content that you decided to do over. Since recording video would
generate large files, the recording sessions are also audio only.

### Before Recording

Before recording, you should ask the host any questions that you might have.
The host might ask you clarifying questions such as your title or how to
pronunce your name. When recording starts, you'll usually be able to hear
a message and see a notification about it (depending on the app) and the
host will open the episode by introducting you, and then asking you questions.

### Recording Tips

Some tips for recording include:

 - Find a quiet room, ideally a smaller one if possible for better sound.
 - Recording with a legit microphone, or headset with microphone, tends to produce the best results. If you don't have one, you can usually find a cheap one on Amazon, or borrow from a colleage. If you can't get one, then you can record using your computer. The audio is important, but it should not disqualify you to be a guest if you are not able to get the recommended devices.
 - If you are a fast speaker, try to slow down a little bitter to make for easier listening and editing.
 - If you need to pause and think, take your time! It's fairly common to have pauses even up to minutes to think about an answer. The host will not feel awkward or judge you for it, but will be happy to wait quietly.
 - This is more recommended for the host (who talks much less), but if you find that the host is talking more, it's helpful to mute your microphone for better sound quality. The host will definitely be doing this as you are speaking.
 
### Recording Content 

The host will come up with questions to ask you, either in advance or on the
fly, so you shouldn't worry about preparing any content in advance. However,
if you want the host to focus in on particular topics or projects, please
tell them in advance and they will follow suit. If the host asks you a question
that you don't want to answer or don't feel comfortable answering, just tell them,
and they will move on. You should not feel uncomfortable in the recording session,
and if you are in any way, make sure to talk to the host so that these issues can
be addressed before moving forward.

### Time

A typical episode ran range anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes, with occasional longer
episodes around 35 minutes. To get this amount of content, it usually requires at
least 45 minutes of recording. For this reason, although you are likely to finish before
the hour, you should leave the entire hour open for recording.

### Post Recording

After the episode, the host will stop recording, and then typically tell you what
to expect next. The time to edit the episode will vary by host, but reasonable if
the release date is in the far future, you can expect a few weeks to a month.
When a first draft is ready, the host will send you the episode to preview. You
can ask for any kind of change that you like. If you've changed your mind, you
can ask the episode to not be released. While we would be disappointed, it's 
important that we do not release anything you are not comfortable with. Finally,
if you want to provide links, images, description, or even write your own show notes
for the episode, you can send this to the host at any time.

### Release Day!

On release day, the episode will be posted to both the USRSE and UKRSE slacks,
and on social media (generally Twitter). You are encouraged to share this in
other places that you might have colleagues, friends, or family to listen,
such as LinkedIn, your Facebook, or just direct emails. Your episode is yours,
and you should be proud of it!

If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to 
[open an issue here](https://github.com/USRSE/rse-stories/issues) or reach out
to a host privately. We are here to help.
