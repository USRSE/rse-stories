# Research Software Engineer Stories

What is a research software engineer? How can we compare
applies and organges, when one person might be heavily involved in open source 
software engineering, and another actively publishing, and a third with managerial duties,
and a fourth doing administration for HPC? This small podcast series attempts to
identify just that.

You can then add the front end matter to the post page:

and it will be rendered as a link from the post.
