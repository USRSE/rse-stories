# Research Software Engineer Stories

What is a research software engineer? How can we compare
applies and organges, when one person might be heavily involved in open source 
software engineering, and another actively publishing, and a third with managerial duties,
and a fourth doing administration for HPC? This small podcast series attempts to
identify just that.

## Transcripts

If you'd like to contribute a transcript, you can create a file (with the same 
date and title as the post) in the [pages/transcripts](pages/transcripts) folder.
You can then add the front end matter to the post page:

```yaml
transcript: 2019-11-7-adam-erck
```

and it will be rendered as a link from the post.
