## Research Software Engineer Stories

Welcome to RSE Stories! Here we share stories from research software engineers to better understand
the many <a href="https://us-rse.org/rse-phenotype/about/" target="_blank">phenotypes</a> and facets
that can define an RSE. As initiatives to empower RSEs take off in both the <a href="https://us-rse.org" target="_blank">United States</a> and 
the <a href="https://rse.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UK</a>, whether you
are a scientist, a programmer, or something else, your story is interesting and unique, and we want to hear about it!
