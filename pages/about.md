In early 2019 when <a href="https://us-rse.org" target="_blank">US-RSE</a>
was being established, it was quickly clear that <a href="https://us-rse.org/what-is-an-rse/" target="_blank">
defining a research software engineer</a> would be a challenging task. How could we compare
apples and oranges, when one person might be heavily involved in open source 
software engineering, and another actively publishing, and a third with managerial duties,
and a fourth doing administration for HPC?

RSE Stories is not limited to research software engineers in the United States.
The host @vsoch happens to be located there, but it's important that we share
stories from across the RSE community, regardless of your geographic location.

## Efforts to Define

While a more rigorous analysis would be warranted, there were several early efforts to 
start to discuss the definition of RSE:

 - [Super RSEs](https://danielskatzblog.wordpress.com/2019/07/12/super-rses-combining-research-and-service-in-three-dimensions-of-research-software-engineering/) was a proposal that hypothesized three dimensions for RSEs.
 - [The Story of the Research Software Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trAfA9VWLTQ) presented the question as a story, and discussed <a href="https://vsoch.github.io/2019/the-research-software-engineer/#what-is-an-rse" target="_blank">different types of RSEs</a>
 - [The RSE Phenotype Generator](https://us-rse.org/rse-phenotype/) took the stance that the best way to define RSE was to ask people directly, and have them define any number of dimensions and communities served.
 - [The USRSE Blog](https://us-rse.org/blog/) can take similar initiative by presenting the work of a small set of self-selected RSEs.
 - [Why Research Software Engineers](http://urssi.us/blog/2019/04/16/why-research-software-engineers/) touched on the topic by describing the need for RSEs.

## A Limited Scope

Do you see the issue with any of the above links? The challenge is that they come from
a single (or small number) of perspectives. In fact, the most compelling definitions for 
what encompasses a research software engineer must come from the community itself.
For this reason, we've created this podcast series to tell the stories of the hidden faces
of research software engineering.

If you are interested in being interviewed for our show, please let us know! There
is no official release schedule or advertising, so the interaction is fun and casual,
and releases will be done as they are recorded and edited. We ask participants to create
their RSE Phenotype, a plot that show the dimensions that define, and communities they are 
relevant for, as a practice in self introspection using the <a href="https://us-rse.org/rse-phenotype/" target="_blank">RSE Phenotype Generator</a>. It's up to you if you want to share the final
graphic with RSE Stories, but we encourage you to do so!
