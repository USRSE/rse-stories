Do you know anything about Debian packaging, or reproducible neuroscience?
No worries, Yarik is an Adjunt and Research Associate Professor at Dartmouth College, and both studies and writes software to study the brain, and he can tell you all about it.
Along with his expertise in package management, he's the founding director for the Center for Open Neuroscience, and is also the lead of DataLad. From all fronts, Yarik is helping to drive reproducible neuroscience, and he'll tell you all about it.
