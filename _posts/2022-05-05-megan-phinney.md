Lab after her graduation this month! In this episode, Megan tells us her story of stumbling on a national lab (hint, a funky pen is involved!)
and her early experiences working as an intern at LANL, and how important a particular teacher was to her path. We discuss
how research software engineering might relate to HPC, the student cluster competition at the Supercomputing (SC) conference, 
the importance of people, and projects Charliecloud and squashfs.
