How long have Research Software Engineering groups been around? How do you
organically grow a group at your institution? This week we talk with Charles
Ferenbaugh, a computational scientist at Los Alamos National Lab. Charles
has rich experience from industry to national labs, and offers some
interesting insights on the matter. Oh, and we also talk about his favorite ice
cream too. We hope you enjoy the conversation!
