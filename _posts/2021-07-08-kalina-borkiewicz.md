Research Software Engineering is so much more than supercomputers and scientific programming.
In this episode of RSE Stories we meet Kalina Borkiewicz, a Research Software Engineer in
the Advanced Visualization lab that works on scientific visualization. We aren't talking about
plots and websites -- Kalina works on award winning cinematic visualizations that are narrated
by celebrities and showcased at major film festivals. Have you heard of "A Beautiful Planet"
or "Seeing the Beginning of Time?" If so, you might have even seen some of her
documentaries. This is an exciting episode because Kalina embodies how truly diverse the roles
of research software engineers can be. For aspiring scientific visualization engineers, 
Kalina suggests keeping an open mind, and being curious to explore many different kinds
of domains and challenges.
