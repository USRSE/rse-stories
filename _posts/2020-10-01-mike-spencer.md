Well before he realised he is an RSE [Mike](https://twitter.com/MikeRSpencer) was already involved in software development and data science for some time. And you can't help but be impressed with the range of projects Mike has been [working on](https://scottishsnow.wordpress.com). In this episode we focus on two of them: snow fall in Britain and livestock movement for [Scotland's Rural College](https://ww1.sruc.ac.uk). His and his colleagues' work provide data for policy influencers and makers. It is therefore important that the quality of data and underlying assumptions are properly assessed. Getting this balance right is often difficult and requires, as Mike says, "pushing the bubble".
