Happy New Year listeners! For [this week's episode](https://us-rse.org/rse-stories-episodes-1/2021/rse-stories-tania-allard-episode-47.mp3), we talk to the passionate Tania Allard, previously a Developer Advocate at Microsoft, and [recently announced](https://twitter.com/ixek/status/1346147165136105477) in a new role
as co-director for Quansight Labs. Congratulations Tania! But for Tania, we suspect
a change in role does not change her passions for developing and leading communities,
Python, and developing beautiful resources and software. In this episode of RSE Stories, we talk about
the magic of open source, the importance of training, and adding a little extra spark to
make our development experiences that much better.
