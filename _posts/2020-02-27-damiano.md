We sometimes falsely attribute dislike for a domain or career to the work
itself, when in fact the underlying factor of people plays a significant role.
In this first ever episode of RSE Stories with a non US-based RSE,
 we welcome Damino Oldoni, a research software engineer and photographer
based in Belgium that is passionate not only about the science,
but also about teaching and working with the people that embark on it.
