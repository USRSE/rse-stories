Jong is the Deputy Associate Directory of Software at NCSA, working closely with
one of our previous guests, [Kenton McHenry](https://us-rse.org/rse-stories/2020/kenton-mchenry/).
Jong's story is important because it shows diversity of expertise - Jong started
working as a research scientist in urban planning, and has followed the needs of
his community to now be a leader in helping with both career paths of engineers,
running his own projects as a PI, and supporting the user community. Have you heard
of Brown Dog, or maybe Brown Dog pizza? You won't know what I'm talking about unless
you listen to the episode!
