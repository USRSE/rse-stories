Last time in the SC22 Mini-series, we learned about the Early Career Program (ECP)
from its chair, Marina Kraeva. Today we get a first-hand glimpse into what the program can
offer its attendees as we talk to six previous ECP participants.

Our six guests in this episode are Sameh Abdulah, Jean Luca Bez, Silvina Caino-Lores,
Hang Liu, Valeria Barra, and Bashir Mohammed. In a mix of one-on-one and panel interviews,
these past attendees tell us how ECP taught them valuable professional
lessons from funding to time management to mentor-mentee relationship building,
as well as created lasting connections and a sense of community with a network of both their peers and
more senior scientists and researchers.

All participants encourage any professionals in their early career to apply for
the program this year, taking place in Dallas, TX, as part of Supercomputing 2022. To apply,
visit the [Early Career Program page](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/submit/early-career-applications/).

As a bonus, two of our interviewees also spoke to Marina Kraeva for an SC22 blog
post! Check it out on the [SC22 Blog Posts Page](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/2022/06/11/the-early-career-program-helped-four-young-professionals-thrive-and-you-can-too/).
