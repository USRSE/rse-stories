For this episode we go (virtually) to Australia to meet with [Nick May](https://twitter.com/eresengineer). Nick spent a long time in the private sector working for a wide range of different companies - large and small.
At some stage he decided to go back to university to get a degree in computer science. "I learnt how I should have done things" he says. Not content with that, he joined the growing community of RSEs in Australia and New Zealand. Today, Nick is the secretary of the [RSE Association of Australia and New Zealand](https://rse-aunz.github.io) and helping to expand this community further.
Oh, and ask him about bread-baking! Nick grows and cultivates his own sourdough.
