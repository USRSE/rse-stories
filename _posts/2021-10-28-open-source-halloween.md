Happy Halloween listeners! This is the third Halloween special episide of the Research Software Engineer Stories Podcast,
and this year we have a story that you might relate to, and give you a spurt of magic. You see, this year we
get a glipse of what it means to have an Open Source Halloween. What would it mean if candy were akin to software?
To go along with the episode, I've created for you the [Open Source Candy Genereator](https://vsoch.github.io/candy-generator/)
where, if you create a piece of candy, it will show up on the [Open Source Halloween](https://rseng.github.io/open-source-halloween/) portal.
Whether you have kiddles that you can go out with to Trick or Treat, or if you are like me and just revel in the decorated houses,
purples and oranges, and making Halloween candy houses, from the Research Software Engineer Stories podcast we wish you a Happy Halloween!
