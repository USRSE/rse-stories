The principle format of science communication - the research article - hasn't changed for a very long time. But research, the sharing and communication of data have all changed dramatically. Therefore, is the traditional way of publishing articles in journals still the best way to share scientific results and discoveries?  
 
This is a question that this episode's guest, [Emmy Tsang](https://twitter.com/emmy_ft), is focusing on at [eLife Sciences](https://elifsciences.org) - a non-profit organisation created by funders and researchers. 
Following her Ph.D. years in neuroscience, Emmy decided it is time to bring some badly needed change to the way we communicate science. With so much research based on software, we have the opportunity to share science fairer, openly, faster and reproducible. Emmy mentions some of the (many other) initiatives that aim to address this:  
- [stencila](https://github.com/stencila/hub) using open source tools to author and share executable documents; 
- [Code Check](https://codecheck.org.uk) can your research code checked independently;
- [Binder](https://mybinder.org) which helps to turn Jupyter notebook repositories into executable environments; 
- [Hypergraph](https://www.libscie.org/hypergraph) share your research as you go.

So, what is the future of scientific communication? Will it be the [executable research article](https://elifesciences.org/labs/dc5acbde/welcome-to-a-new-era-of-reproducible-publishing)? Will the published article be divided into distinct units (e.g. methods, experiments, conclusions) published and shared individually? 
As Emmy says, this needs to be a community effort. If you have ideas and suggestions Emmy would like you to get in touch via [@eLifeInnovation](https://twitter.com/eLifeInnovation) or [email](mailto:innovation@elifesciences.org).
