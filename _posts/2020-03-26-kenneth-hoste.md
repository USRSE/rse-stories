One of the greatest joys is meeting a research software engineer
that is so passionate about their craft that it flows out of them.
This is definitely the case for Kenneth Hoste, an HPC Systems Administrator
in Belgium that found himself strongly to be in the role of RSE
while he was working on the EasyBuild project on behalf of his research community.
In this week's episode of RSE Stories, we chat with Kenneth, 
and learn about how to grow a community, and about the intersection between HPC and
research software. And do you want to know how to make a package manager,
or a container cry? This is the episode for you!
