Today we have the pleasure of speaking with Damian Rouson, the founder and president
of the Sorcery Institute that provides training and services for software development.
And guess what, he's frequented national labs, written books, and has carved out
a unique spot in the research software ecosystem. Does he consider himself a research
software engineer? How do you even start to think about starting your own company?
In this episode, we discuss object oriented design, Fortran, parallelism, and
how following the needs of a community can lead to an interesting and fulfilling
career path.
