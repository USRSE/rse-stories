On this episode of RSE Stories, we are joined by Ver贸nica Melesse Vergara,
an HPC engineer at Oak Ridge National Lab. Veronica shares with us how she has
consistently followed her passion and need for sunshine to find herself
at Oak Ridge in a challenging leadership role that she continues
to learn from every day. If you are interested in Oak Ridge National Lab or
any associated projects, please reach out to Ver贸nica.
