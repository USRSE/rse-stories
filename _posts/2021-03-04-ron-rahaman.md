Ron is a software engineer at Argonne National Lab, and shares with us his story
about realizing the potential for a good career by pursuing software engineering,
and eventually finding his way from early career training to having a job at Argonne.
Does Argonne have a representation of a research software engineer? How important are
students and training for our future? What kind of work
does Ron care about? You should listen to this episode to find out!

And a special thank you to Ron, who not only was a guest on RSE Stories, but
fully edited his own episode! This is an awesome example of the podcast being
a team, and community effort.
