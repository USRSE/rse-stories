In this episode of RSE Stories we talk with Julian Pistorius, a software
engineer and self-proclaimed organic software farmer at the College of Agriculture
and Life Sciences, or more specifically, at the Digital Innovations for
Agriculture Group (DIAG) at the University of Arizona. Julian is co-lead to
a project called Exosphere, which he describes as an OnDemand for cloud computing.
Listen closely for insights to taking care of communities, software projects,
and how a research software engineer can think about his or her place in
the two.
