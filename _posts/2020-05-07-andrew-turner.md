In this 17th Episode of Research Software Engineer Stories, we interview
Andrew Turner, a research software engineer that leads a team at the University
of Edinburgh, and discuss how research software engineering has brought a sense
of belonging to so many that did not have it before. Andrew shares his hopes
for the future, personal challenges, and a little bit of beauty that you might
not know exists in caving.
