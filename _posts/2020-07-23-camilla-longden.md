Today we meet with Camilla Longden ([@scamillalongden](https://twitter.com/camillalongden)). Camilla is a research software engineer at Microsoft. I met Camilla at an RSE workshop in London early 2020, where she presented her work in AI and machine learning. Camilla's ambition is to create tools that improve and enhance our lives. Judging by the exciting work she does at project [Tokyo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-tokyo/) she has a good chance of achieving her goal. The aim of the project is to help visually impaired people, particularly children and young adults, using augmented reality. As part of our discussion we touch on the important subject of [ethics](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai) in AI/ML. As Camilla says, it "starts at the team level".
