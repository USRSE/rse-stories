Have you ever wondered about the story of the host behind this podcast?
Flipping the interview of the [very first episode](https://us-rse.org/rse-stories/2019/ian-cosden/)
almost two years ago, for this week's episode special guest host Ian Cosden interviews Vanessa Sochat,
a Computer Scientist at Lawrence Livermore National lab and founder of the RSE Stories podcast. 
Vanessa started as a researcher in neuroinformatics, fell in love with programming, 
and embarked on her own journey through self-taught programming, graduate school, her first role as a Research Software
Engineer in the Stanford Research Computing Center, up until where she is today.
In this episode, Vanessa shares her journey, a non-traditional view about what defines
"research software engineering," and why in the world she is an avocado loving [dinosaur]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/posts/vsoch/vanessasaurus.mp4).
