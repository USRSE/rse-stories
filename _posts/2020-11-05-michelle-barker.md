For this episode we go again to Australia to meet with [Michelle Barker](https://twitter.com/michelle1barker), director of the [Research Software Alliance](https://www.researchsoft.org/). Michelle has extensive expertise in open science, research software, digital workforce capability and digital research infrastructure. She is on the advisory committee for the [US Software Sustainability Institute](http://urssi.us) and recently chaired the OECD Global Science Forum expert group on [digital skills for the research sector](https://www.innovationpolicyplatform.org/www.innovationpolicyplatform.org/digital-skills-data-intensive-science-oecd-project/index.html). Building and increasing skills, approaches to digital solutions and implementations is often hard. These are the kind of challenges Michelle thrives on. E.g. by using systematic approaches such as [Kotter's 8 steps for leading change](https://www.kotterinc.com/8-steps-process-for-leading-change/).
In all these endeavours it is clear that open science does and will play a critical role.
