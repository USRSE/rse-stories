[Anna Krystalli's](https://twitter.com/annakrystalli) career took a number of interesting turns. It all started in macro biology, where Anna helped analyse data from one of the longest running ecological surveys: the [Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey](https://www.cprsurvey.org). Munching all the data took her into the exciting world of R programming. There she started to play an increasingly important role in the R community. This included taking on the role of associate editor of [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/). Anna is passionate about making software  more open, accessible and reproducible. As one of the RSE Fellows she has been instrumental in initiatives like the [ReproHack](https://github.com/reprohack/reprohack-hq). And if you ever happen to be in Sheffield, enjoy the great music scene and - climbing.
