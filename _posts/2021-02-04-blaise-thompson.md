Does your institution have an electronics shop? What goes on there, and is it
research software engineering? In this episode, we talk with Blaise Thompson, an instrumental technologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Blaise shares with us the value
of building instruments for research, and that now is the time to rethink and revamp these
institutional shops to better serve the research community. Do you do work in instrumentation
or are you interested in this work? Let's start discussion and channels in our slacks!
