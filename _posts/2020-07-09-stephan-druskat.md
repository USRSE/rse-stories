Today we go to Berlin in Germany to meet with Stephan Druskat (@stdruskat). Stephan is a research software engineer at
the Alexander-von-Humboldt Universit√§t in Berlin (https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/). 
Stephan has been involved with a lot of exciting research on
linguistics, such as the study of oceanic languages (https://www.projekte.hu-berlin.de/en/melatamp). 
Together with other research software engineers he worked on
making software an integral part of publications through 'software citation' (https://elib.dlr.de/133021/1/druskat-cise-2019.pdf) 
and has played an important role in building the RSE community in Germany.
