Today we go to Berlin in Germany to meet with Stephan Druskat. Stephan is a research software engineer at
the Alexander-von-Humboldt Universit√§t in Berlin. Stephan has been involved with a lot of exciting research on
linguistics, such as the study of oceanic languages. Together with other research software engineers he worked on
making software an integral part of publications through 'software citation' and has played an important role in
building the RSE community in Germany.
