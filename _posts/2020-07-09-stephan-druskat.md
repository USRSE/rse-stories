Today we go to Berlin in Germany to meet with Stephan Druskat (@stdruskat). Stephan is a research software engineer at
the [Alexander-von-Humboldt Universit√§t in Berlin](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/).
He has been involved with a lot of exciting research on
linguistics, such as the study of oceanic languages (https://www.projekte.hu-berlin.de/en/melatamp).
Another focus of his work has been "software citation" and ensuring that software becomes a valid and recognised output of research (https://elib.dlr.de/133021/1/druskat-cise-2019.pdf).
And if that isn't enough, Stephan plays an important part in building the RSE community (https://dh-rse.github.io) in Germany.
