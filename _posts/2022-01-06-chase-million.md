Welcome to the New Year, my dearest reader! We open 2022 with our 69th episode,
an interview with Chase Million, the CEO of Million Concepts, a research
and consulting company with expertise in planetary science, remote sensing, and
astronomy. Chase presents us with a less commonly seen model for providing
research software engineering services, and tells us the story of how he went off
any established path to pursue work that he simply didn't see possible to do in 
traditional academia. Are you business minded, or have you ever thought about
leaving the constraints of academia? This is one story you'll want to hear!
