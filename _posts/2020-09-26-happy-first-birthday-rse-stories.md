Just one year ago today we released the first episode of Research Software Engineer
Stories with [Ian Cosden](https://us-rse.org/rse-stories/2019/ian-cosden/). The goal
was simple - to tell the stories of a very diverse set of talented individuals, not quite
researchers, but not quite software engineers, and going in so many directions beyond that!
We are amazingly one year in, having recorded, edited, and produced episodes through a pandemic,
and finding a lovely co-host, Peter, along the way! So without further adieu,
in celebration of our first episode, let's share some Pancakes.
