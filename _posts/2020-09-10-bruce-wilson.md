Only a few minutes into our convsersation, I knew that Bruce Wilson, a research
systems engineer at Oak Ridge National Lab, had rich life experiences and both
wisdom and depth from them. In our 33rd episode of Research Software Engineer Stories,
we talk with Bruce not only about trends in systems engineering, but also empathy for self
and others, team dynamics, diversity, and mental health. Bruce shares his story of
shifting roles, and how solving challenges with domain scientists has brought him joy.
