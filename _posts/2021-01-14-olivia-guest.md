[Olivia Guest](https://oliviaguest.com) is a cognitive scientist and computational cognitive modeller at the [Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) at Radboud University, Netherlands.
Many may also know Olivia from her popular blog post [Neuroplausible](https://neuroplausible.com). In this episode Olivia takes us through her journey to become a computational scientists. We also discuss two of her blog-posts with the catchy titles of [I hate Mathlab](https://neuroplausible.com/matlab) and [Why Women in Psychology Can't Program](https://neuroplausible.com/programming). Creating a level playing field in computing for people from different backgrounds requires us to rethink the way we teach computing and build up problem solving skills. As Olivia says: 'teach them how to code'.
