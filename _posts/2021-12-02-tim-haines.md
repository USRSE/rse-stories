Tim Haines is one of those people you would be lucky to have as a colleague.
If you spend just a few minutes with Tim, you'll quickly find yourself having fun. Why? Tim is one of those
people that is easy to laugh, and unbelievably smart and so wanting to share this with you.
In this episode of Research Software Engineer stories, Tim tells his extensive journey
through academia (17 years!) touching astophysics, computer science, and software engineering.
But was it about the pieces of paper? Not for Tim - he has a passion for learning,
and shares this with us today through our conversation about compilers, application binary
interfaces, and systems programming.

If you too like learning and enjoy reading, we've linked a bunch of Tim's favorite books
and his [CppCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5Z4JlMJ1VQ) from a few years back.
