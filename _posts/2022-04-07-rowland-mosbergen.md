For the most part when I've been introduced to DEI groups and initiatives, they mean well but I'm left feeling a bit lost.
I either don't fully understand what I can do, or I don't think the initiative itself fully grasps the depth of the issue.
My view on DEI, "Diversity, Equity and Inclusion" changed when I watched a talk by Rowland Mosbergen, a strategic leader at 
the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Australia, and founder of [Practical Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.practicaldiversity.org/), a resource for improving Diversity and Inclusion for individuals and organizations to use. Rowland is one of those people
that you talk to and you are given pause, because he's given insights you've never thought about before. In this episode of RSE
Stories, we talk to Rowland about his life experiences, and how important it is for all of us to advocate for others. We talk
about challenges and strengths of the RSE community, interviewing, and how we collaborate across communities. This was
one of my favorite conversations that I've had on the show, and I hope that you find it leaves as impression as well.
