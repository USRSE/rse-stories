For this episode of RSE Stories, we interview Todd Gamblin, a computer scientist
from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that 
thrives in the gray area between hardware, HPC, and open source development.
Todd shares his journey to be working at a National Lab, and how
getting angry at software led to development of a hugely popular package 
manager, Spack.
