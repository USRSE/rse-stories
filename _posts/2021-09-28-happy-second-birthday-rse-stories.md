September 26, 2021 was the second birthday of Research Software Engineer Stories, and we've had such a journey!
We've had 65 episodes, three hosts, and we've been working hard to ensure that diverse stories
of Research Software Engineers are told. So again, let's wish a happy second birthday to
RSE Stories! 🎂️
