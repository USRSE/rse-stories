Robin Wilson has an impressive body of work, from creating a new method to monitor air pollution from satellites
at high spatial resolution, to writing scientific software and creating means for open data. He now is thriving
doing freelance work, and has an important story to share with our RSE community. You see, Robin
is in a wheelchair. It wasn't something he expected, but it's changed his life and given him
perspective about how important it is for our community to embrace diversity and support disability.
We hope that you listen to this episode, hear what Robin has to say, and take it to heart
to help figure out what we can do, together, to make our world a better place.
