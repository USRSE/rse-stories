Dan Katz is a Chief Scientist at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.
But you might recoginize him from Better Scientific Software, The Software Sustainability
Institute, or the Journal of Open Source Software. In this episode, we talk about software,
citation and best practices, but we also talk about the community around it, and the importance of policy and people.

> Make sure to check out a special post, [Valuing People vs. Hardware](https://danielskatzblog.wordpress.com/2021/02/18/valuing-people-vs-hardware/) that Dan has written to supplement this episode.
