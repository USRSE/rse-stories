In this episode I talk to [Brian Hills](https://twitter.com/brianhills) deputy CEO and Head of Service Design for the [DataLab](https://www.thedatalab.com) in Scotland. Brian joined the team after many years in the private sector. And his experiences there helps him work with universities and companies to bridge the gap in skills we have today. Working in AI/ML is often misunderstood. Many downplay the importance of good, solid data engineering. As Brian points out, he had companies remarking that new graduates often want to work on algorithms rather than "cleaning up the data" for processing. 
Ethics in data science also plays a key role. With data science playing an increasingly important role in all our lives engineers working in the field need to employ a solid set of ethical values and use proper toolkits.
