[Olivia Guest](https://oliviaguest.com) is a cognitive scientist and computational cognitive modeler at the [Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging](https://www.ru.nl/donders/) at Radboud University, Netherlands.
Many may also know Olivia from her popular blog post [Neuroplausible](https://neuroplausible.com). In this episode Olivia takes us through her journey to become a computational scientist. We also discuss two of her blog posts with the catchy titles of [I hate Matlab](https://neuroplausible.com/matlab) and [Why Women in Psychology Can't Program](https://neuroplausible.com/programming). Creating a level playing field in computing for people from different backgrounds requires us to rethink the way we teach computing and build up problem solving skills. As Olivia says, "Teach them how to code."
