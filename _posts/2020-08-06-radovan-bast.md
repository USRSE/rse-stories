Today we meet with Radovan Bast ([@__radovan](https://twitter.com/__radovan), [Homepage](https://bast.fr)) from Tromsø in Northern Norway. Radovan moved into software engineering via theoretical chemistry. The journey wasn't easy, or as Radovan put it "I had imposter syndrome". However, one of the highlights in this transition has been teaching others software and watch "eyes opening and lights turning on". In our session we talk about some of Radovan's exciting projects like [Cicero - shared presentations] (https://github.com/bast/cicero) or filtering and finding [misinformation](https://threat-defuser.org). He is also co-author of the [CMake Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/cmake-cookbook).

Radovan is closely working with colleagues in Norway, Sweden, Finland and other countries to build and grow a Nordic RSE organisation, kicking off with a [conference] (https://nordic-rse.org/conference/) planned for December 2020 in Stockholm (Covid-19 permitting).
