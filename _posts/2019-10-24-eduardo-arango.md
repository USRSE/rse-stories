Eduardo works remotely from Colombia, and impressively spans the space between academia
and industry as both a PhD student and software engineer for Sylabs. In this episode
of RSE Stories, we discuss remote life, the interesting lifecycle of software that
moves from academia to industry and back, and some of the challenges for the
upcoming year for both open source and HPC.
