What is the line between a biostatistician and a data scientist? And how does the work or impact differ between
academia and industry? Today on RSE Stories we talk to Daniel Sabanés Bové, a Senior Principal Data Scientist and Associate Director at Roche who graduated from the University of Zurich with a PhD in statistics. Not only does Daniel build tools, he has published a statistics book, leads a team, and can see his work trickling down to the production of medicine. So what does a bioengineer do at a company like Roche? He's engineering
tools for statisticians to do better work or gain insights, and often even open-sourcing them! And he loves his job.
Are you interested in biostatistics or collaboration in this domain? Daniel would be a good person to reach out to, and this episode a good one to listen to!
