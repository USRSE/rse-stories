Daniel N√ºst is a research software engineer working on the project "Opening
Reproducible Research" at the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of
M√ºnster. In this episode, we talk about RSE career paths, reproducible
research, and computational workflows under peer review.

---------

After finding his dream discipline of geoinformatics as a student,
[Daniel N√ºst](https://nordholmen.net/) continued learning more about the
Earth by supporting researchers with latest computer science methods as
a developer and consultant at [52¬∞North](https://52north.org/), a
non-profit company for applied research with Open Source software. An
RSE by tasks but not title already then, he joined the German RSE
community while pursuing a PhD back at the Institute for Geoinformatics
at the university of M√ºnster. Now he is vice-chair of the [German RSE
association](https://de-rse.org/en/) and conducts research in the areas
of Open Science and computational reproducibility.

## Shownotes

If you want to learn more about the 52¬∞North Initiative for Geospatial Open 
Source Software GmbH, a non-profit private research organisation and network for innovation,
check out [https://52north.org/about-us/profile/](https://52north.org/about-us/profile/).

For the service, Daniel created short and long reading lists around
reproducibility, sorted by time available to spend. See 
[here](https://confluence.uni-muenster.de/display/r2s2/Reproducible+research%3A+general+material) for details.

On research software vs. career paths and recognition of RSE work, you should
check out de-RSE's first position paper _[An environment for sustainable research
software in Germany and beyond: current state, open challenges, and call
for action](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.23224.1)_.
