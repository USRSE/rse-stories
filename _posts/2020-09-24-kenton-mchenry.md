In this episode of Research Software Engineer Stories, we talk with Kenton McHenry,
Associate Director for Software at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NSCA). 
What do we really want as research software engineers for our careers? It might
be related to having a mindset for growth, a diverse skillset, and an established career
path. Or maybe it's just knowing that we are not alone. Kenton's journey has led him to think
about all these questions, and more.
