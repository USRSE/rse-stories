This week on RSE Stories we chat with Stuart Bowman, a simulations engineer
at the MITRE, who is working to "solve problems for a safer world" that range
from airplanes to emerging technologies. Stuart offers a valuable perspective
about an option for a research software engineer that cares deeply about
solving problems and helping people, but doesn't necessarily want to stay in
academia. Have you wondered what it takes to be a pilot, or how air travel
is worked on from a research perspective? Take a listen!
