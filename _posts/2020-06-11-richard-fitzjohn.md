In this episode of RSE Stories we talk to Richard Fitzjohn. Richard leads a team of research software engineers (RSE) at the MRC (Medical Research Council) Centre for Global Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College in London, UK. Richard's background is in theoretical evolutionary biology. In his role at Imperial he and his team help epidemiologists develop models for infectious diseases. Lately, this meant modelling the coronavirus outbreak. What does this work entail? And - since some of the models have been made public - how can research software engineers ensure that best practices and standards are maintained?
