What's it like to be a leader for a software project in graduate school? For this second episode, we interview 
<a href="https://nmbl.stanford.edu/people/christopher-dembia/" target="_blank">Chris Dembia</a>,
a graduate student finishing up his career that found his niche as an OpenSim developer. 
We discuss the challenges of finding balance in graduate school, and making choices about next steps.
