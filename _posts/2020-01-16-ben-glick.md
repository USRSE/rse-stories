For this second episode of the new year, we interview Ben Glick, who is our
first undergraduate guest on RSE Stories. Ben shares his experience of setting
up an HPC cluster at Lewis and Clark College, and some of his thoughts on
research software engineering. If you think software is risky, wait until
you hear about Samoan Fire Knife Dancing!
