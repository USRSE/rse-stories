When you love technology regardless of the domain of science that is using it, 
it's often challenging to find a niche in a traditional academic role. In this episode
of RSE Stories, We talk to Joe Schoonover, the CEO of Fluid Numerics. Joe found
himself in this exact position after graduate school and trying out a postdoc,
and embarked on an adventure to start his own company. In this episode
we discuss cloud vs. HPC, what it's like to start your own company, and challenges
in both of those spaces.
