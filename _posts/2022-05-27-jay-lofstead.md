Jay Lofstead is a member of technical staff at Sandia National Laboratories
and this year's Supercomputing 2022 (SC22) Inclusivity Committee Chair. In this
episode, Jay tells us about his experiences volunteering with SC over the past
few years, the history of the Inclusivity committee, and his plans for
implementing change to make Supercomputing 2022 a truly accessible and
inclusive environment for all participants!

He also ends with a call to action. If you have feedback about your experiences
at Supercomputing which could help Jay improve inclusivity, please email the
committee at [sc-inclusivity@info.supercomputing.org](mailto:sc-inclusivity@info.supercomputing.org).
