What is synthetic biology, and where do open source and biology collide? This
week on Research Software Engineer Stories we are joined by Keoni Gandall,
a proud biohacker and researcher in the Endy Lab at Stanford University.
Have you ever thought about what it would mean to empower farmers to design
their own seeds, or grow a boot? What does work look like in a bioengineering lab? 
Tune in to learn more about a topic that you may be surprised by.
